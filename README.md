# Processdocs
Processdocs – reads in pdf, docx and rtf files and performs the following:

•	Strips off the punctuation and lowercases all text

•	Replaces URLs, numbers and emails with strings

•	Destems all words (using an implementation of the porter stemmer)

•	Writes out the processed files with same file name but with a .txt suffice

•	Creates a dictionary (dictionary.txt) of all unique words (column 1) and word frequency (column 2).
